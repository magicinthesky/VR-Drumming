### Project Description  
1. **Developed a virtual environment for the simulation with the following aspects**:
- High-fidelity drum set
- High-fidelity drumsticks
- Moderate-fidelity chair
- A low-fidelity garage or living room environment
- Distinct sounds for striking each drum and cymbal
  
2. **Developed 3D interactions for the simulation with the following aspects**:
- Ability to use drumsticks to strike each drum and cymbal
- Modify sounds based on the force of each strike
- Modify sounds based on the position of each strike
- Ability to simulate sitting on the chair without physically sitting
- Ability to simulate standing up from the chair
  
3. **Developed logic for the simulation with the following aspects**:
- Visual and auditory instructions on how to play a specific song
- Visual and auditory feedback on the force of each strike
- Visual and auditory feedback on the position of each strike
- Visual and auditory feedback on the timing between strikes
- Visual and auditory feedback on incorrect strikes
  
4. **Developed logic for the simulation with the following aspects**:
- Visual and auditory instructions on how to play a specific song
- Visual and auditory feedback on the force of each strike
- Visual and auditory feedback on the position of each strike
- Visual and auditory feedback on the timing between strikes
