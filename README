# VR-Drumming
Developed a VR application that simulates and instructs how to play a drum set

1. Develop a virtual environment for the simulation with the following aspects:
  a. High-fidelity drum set
  b. High-fidelity drumsticks
  c. Moderate-fidelity chair
  d. A low-fidelity garage or living room environment
  e. Distinct sounds for striking each drum and cymbal
  
2. Develop 3D interactions for the simulation with the following aspects:
  a. Ability to use drumsticks to strike each drum and cymbal
  b. Modify sounds based on the force of each strike
  c. Modify sounds based on the position of each strike
  d. Ability to simulate sitting on the chair without physically sitting
  e. Ability to simulate standing up from the chair
  
3. Develop logic for the simulation with the following aspects:
  a. Visual and auditory instructions on how to play a specific song
  b. Visual and auditory feedback on the force of each strike
  c. Visual and auditory feedback on the position of each strike
  d. Visual and auditory feedback on the timing between strikes
  e. Visual and auditory feedback on incorrect strikes
  
4. Develop logic for the simulation with the following aspects:
  a. Visual and auditory instructions on how to play a specific song
  b. Visual and auditory feedback on the force of each strike
  c. Visual and auditory feedback on the position of each strike
  d. Visual and auditory feedback on the timing between strikes
